# Wonderlust   https://wonderlust-yh7u.onrender.com/listings

**Wonderlust** is a **short and simplified clone of Airbnb**. It mimics select functionalities found in Airbnb to help understand full-stack development workflows.

##  Key Features Implemented

- **User authentication** (sign up, log in, session management)  
- **Property listings**: view and navigate different stays (with simplified structure)  
- **Image uploads**: add photos to listings—either using local uploads or cloud storage  
- **Basic search** by location or listing title—demonstrating filtering logic   

> This project is minimal and does **not** include full Airbnb functionality like payments, reviews, advanced host dashboard, messaging, or admin panels.

###  Purpose & Tech Stack

Wonderlust was built to explore:

- **Backend** with Node.js, Express, MongoDB (or another database)—models, routes, controllers  
- **Templating/view layer** with EJS  
- **File/image handling** with upload middleware and cloud configuration  
- **Modular architecture**: separating concerns via controllers, models, routes, and views

4. **Run the app**: `npm start`  
5. **Open** in your browser and explore the limited but functional experience!

##  Why It’s Cool

- Provides a **hands-on exploration** of full-stack architecture with simplified Airbnb-like flows
